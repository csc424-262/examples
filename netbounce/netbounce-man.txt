DESCRIPTION

    listener binds to the given UDP port, listens for a packet
    and echos it back to the source port and source IP.
    
    talker sends the given message in a UDP packet to the given
    port and host, then listens for a packet on port that its
    socket was bound to. It prints out the contents of the returned
    packet to stdout.
    
    The verbose option (-v) will have the listener and talker
    print to stdout the source and destination port and IP of 
    the packets that arrive.
    
    The loop option (-l) will have the server listen repeated on the port.
    Else it exits after one bounce.

    The logging option -f is available on netbounce-server2.
